# Paxos-Algorithm
The aim of the project is to implement the Paxos algorithm. Although, it ensured consistency across replicas, it was prone to failures and was not fault tolerant. To make sure the data is consistent across all the replicas, the paxos algorithm is implemented. The current project is the continuation of project where the RPC was implemented across the servers and client. When a request is placed to server from the client, the prepare phase is initiated first and the current server is elected to be the leader. During this phase, a promise is sent to all the servers (each of the promise carry an ID). The server accepts a promise if it has not accepted any promise previously and if it did accept one already, if the current proposed ID is greater, then the server chooses to accept the higher promise. Promises with smaller ID are ignored. Once the leader gets maximum acceptances, the accept phase is initiated. During this phase, the value along with the promise is passed to all the servers. Once all the servers come to consensus about the value, does not have to be the promise ID because the prepare phase takes care of this, the learners are issued a notification to perform the operation. For the current project I have included random failure during the accept phase and the piggy backing of values is also considered.
